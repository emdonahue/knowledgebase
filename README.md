# kb
A set of utilities for creating a personal, text-minable knowledgebase out of your pdfs, documents, and notes.

A new knowledgebase can be created with `kb init`, which generates the directory structure used by the various utilities. PDFs and other document typse can be dowloaded into the "inbox" directory, and then processed by visiting the root of the knowledgebase directory and running `kb ingest`. Once documents have been processed, the various other utilities can be used to search, annotate, and analyze the collection. Knowledgebases can be created per project, or as one all-purpose knowledgebase for research notes.
